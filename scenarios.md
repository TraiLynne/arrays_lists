# Scenarios

1. Suppose you’re building an app to keep track of your finances. Every day, you write down everything you spent money on. At the end of the month, you review your expenses and sum up how much you spent. So, you have lots of inserts and a few reads. Should you use an array or a list?

2. Suppose you’re building an app for restaurants to take customer orders. Your app needs to store a list of orders. Servers keep adding orders to this list, and chefs take orders off the list and make them. It’s an order queue: servers add orders to the back of the queue, and the chef takes the first order off the queue and cooks it. Would you use an array or a linked list to implement this queue? (Hint: Linked lists are good for inserts/deletes, and arrays are good for random access. Which one are you going to be doing here?)

3. Let’s run a thought experiment. Suppose Facebook keeps a list of usernames. When someone tries to log in to Facebook, a search is done for their username. If their name is in the list of usernames, they can log in. People log in to Facebook pretty often, so there are a lot of searches through this list of usernames. Suppose Facebook uses binary search to search the list. Binary search needs random access—you need to be able to get to the middle of the list of usernames instantly. Knowing this, would you implement the list as an array or a linked list?
   1. An Array

4. People sign up for Facebook pretty often, too. Suppose you decided to use an array to store the list of users. What are the downsides of an array for inserts? In particular, suppose you’re using binary search to search for logins. What happens when you add new users to an array?
   1. When the amount of users gets bigger than the spot alloted for it, it has to move to a new spot that has enough room for the current items plus more room for new items to be added. This leads to a higher time complexity for the insert. On a good day, it is only constant O(1). But when the array has to be moved, it is linear O(n).
